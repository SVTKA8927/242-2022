# 242-2016
Project for CMPS-242 2016

We are using python 3.

## Code
The code directory holds the main project.
You should be able to run run.py straight off the bat.

If you want to hit the database, then follow the same directions bellow about the secrets.py file (except it should be in the the code directory now).

## Data
If you want to run the data extractor, then you need to make sure to create a secrets.py file in the same directory.
This file should define the following constants:
   - DB_HOST
   - DB_PORT
   - DB_NAME
   - DB_USER
   - DB_PASS
