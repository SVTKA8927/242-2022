There was a bug in the Rand Index calculation that slightly raised the results.
The correct value (Rn) can be computed the old (Ro):
$$ R_{n} = \frac^{R_{o}(l + x) - x}_{l} $$

Where $ l $ is the old denominator (1302177 for all the ground truth calculations),
and $ x $ is the number of unique entities in the pairings (3068 for all ground truth calculations).
